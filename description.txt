Project: Battleship
Description: We create two 10 by 10 grids for the 2 players. 
In the initialization of the game both players can place their troops, namely:
- 1 pcs 1x5 ship
- 2 pcs 1x4 ship
- 3 pcs 1x3 ship
- 4 pcs 1x2 ship
- 5 pcs 1x1 ship.

After that, players take turns guessing in their opponent's field (e.g. A1) and shoot a torpedo.
If their hint was correct, the ship (part) in that field will sink, if not, the torpedo will fall into the water.
The player who sinks all of his opponent's ships wins.
